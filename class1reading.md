&nbsp for my reading i learned several things about the markdown syntax.
I learned how relitively easy it is to do several things with mark down. One of the easiest being the header "tag" as opposed to ``` <h1> - <h6> ``` this is done with a pound sign.
the **bold** and *italics* syntacs are pretty straight forward and makes sense when i realized that > two(```**```) means important! and one (```*```) means "style". The block quote seemed top be very interesting feature in instances where sharing code would be important.
