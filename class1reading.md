# My learnings from reading about mark down

## Styling syntax
my reading i learned several things about the markdown syntax.
I learned how relitively easy it is to do several things with mark down. One of the easiest being the header "tag" as opposed to `` <h1> - <h6> `` this is done with a pound sign.
the **bold** and *italics* syntacs are pretty straight forward and makes sense when i realized that > two(``**``) means important! and one (``*``) means "style".

## Quoting
The block quote seemed top be very interesting feature in instances where sharing code would be important. The Quoting text ``>`` feature is very streamline as well.
The "block quotes with multiple paragraphs" is also a really neat featurei have yet to come across prior top this.

## Links/Images 
The easy use of the "link feature ``[link text](example.com)`` in place of what be an anchor tag, makes sharing links and creating interactive contacts (like email socail media links) extremely easy and intuitive. This "language" is very straight forwards and seems to offer very clean "code"(can i say that?)
The ease of sharing images are also very pleasing feature, that once again is concise and straight forward.

## The "specificy theme image is pretty awesome as well.
Although this seems specific to [github](https://www.github.com) this is a very awesome feature.

## Perhaps the most pleasing thing i learned.
I very much so like the simplicity of making a *table* with markdown though opposed to all  the syntax used in HTML/
that is used in HTML.
