# The Brain, A text editors most important extension (a story in 3 parts).

# the sunkin ship *IS* the Treasure
 The Hunt tends to be a huge part of what we do, I mean we as humans were (are?) hunter gatheres and its kind of our thing. Although in this context we are mot hunting for food, we are hunting for a tool... a tool to help us not only wrangle text we are also wrangling computers and with that one could say we are wrangling imaginations, or just trying to make life alittle more simple by allowing our phone to unlock without removing your mask (the *mask* part was very telling of the era this was wrote.)
 # what is said treasure ?
 Its important to back track alittle bit and talk about what a text editor is. Okay really its just as it sounds, it edits text. It is very important tool for developer, because it is the devs. medium. it is our *canvas* so to speak. This is where we write those lines of awesome intricate looking code... those long strings, of beautifully colored code (some text editors have a highlight feature to make writing..most importantly reading code **easier**.) The hours spent to impress your friends to display "Hello World" (tears of joy) is often written on a Text Editor. Now a Text editor can be as intricate or as simple as you want, because there are options. There Visual Studios and Sublime (My favorite) they have really neat features that can help keep you from straining your eyes an even a screen on the side display your code with out having refresh your browser page update what is being displayed. There are many plug-ins to help ease the writing of code... lets not forget the predicitive text....(emmet) it does just as it sounds, it finishes your tags and there is even help to set you up with a closing tag, that can honestly 1/2 the amount of time spent Writing. The most simple form is a text editor we all have on our computers : Note pade, and text edit ( to name a few) are fully capabale of rendering code an can act as a platform for you to begin your coding journey. 
# Okay there is something inside the actual ship, not gold but a decision to be made.
The choice one makes really is dependant on what they feel most comfortable with, The choice of the Text editor can be daunting one, however there is no wrong or right answer, well i guess the right answer is: which one works for you and your task at hand ? I mean there aree different tools for different reasons. The simplicity of Note Pad seems pleasing especially when taking on an undertaking of learning code, but i feel the perks of having a text editor really out weighs any of that stuff. Seek the features that speak to you and your needs: do your eyes strain easy? get one that can add a blue blocker, Do you think that all those tags will look alike? get one that will highlight code, Do you like effeciency? Then pick one (VS code) because emmet is a sweet being. 
# Beyong the editor (one step beyond).
Beyond the text editors, we have IDE's ( Integrated  Developement Environment) which is a topic unto itself. Although there are differences, one of the most notable will be the ability to debug, Complile, and Manage files within the space.. for me thats like having a music studio and fully running kitchen staff in my house..I would have no reason to leave. An IDE has the ability to not just edit the text but to compile the text, what does it mean to compile the text ? W3 reads this
>A compiler is system software (a set of a computer program) that converts source code written in a programming language (source language, usually HLL) into another computer language (target language). It processes every statement written in a particular programming language and turns them to machine language. After writing the program the programmer runs the code in an appropriate language compiler specifying the name of the file that contains the source statements. [^1]. The conecept of an IDE is sort of like a box store like TARGET, it not only carries groceries, but your able to buy a TV, Socks, and maybe even a new pair of pants (or suspenders). Think of it as a one stop shop. I personally feel its a good choice to find a text editor that you can grow into... i did just that. I initially started out with SUblime text, but when i really started to enjoy and take to coding i went with VS code.

### dont be shy jump on in the water is fine.
