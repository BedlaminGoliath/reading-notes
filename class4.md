## Wire Frames

The initial reading in class 4 we learned about wire framing and its importance of it when designing a page. In reality wire framing is a plan or a course of action. It is sketching on paper or using an app to sketch the skeleton of the page you are working on. The example of having a destination before you get into a car is a very good one that I feel most people can relate to. There are not many instances where simply stepping into a vehicle with no destination in mind is a feasable idea, sure it can be fun but for me that sounds very unfun. Take it one step further, what if you were just stepping onto a bus, or any means of puplic transportation with no destination and minimal means to "survive"...That sounds like HELL to me.

## HTML

further into the reading in class 4 we learned basic HTML (hypertext markup language) and its primary use is there to be the actual structure of the page itself. HTML picks up where "Wire Framing" leaves off. After we sketched out our ideas on either a whiteboard, piece of paper, or software, we then take it to our text editor. Within that world we use **elements**.

*An **element** consists of three different parts:*

1. Open tag ``<p>``
2. "content"
3. Closing tag ``</P>``

This would give us: ``<p>contentHere</p>"``
This is the basis for HTML. In that example we used a "paragraph" tag and to no suprise, that is how we would write a paragraph.

However there is much more to be done on HTML and beyond that there are a few "musts" like the ``<!DOCTYPE HTML>`` as the declaration. This was ment to set the "rules" for HTML that would lay the ground work for how the file acted and the rules it would follow as well as offer features like error check and other useful features.

Besides the declarations and basic "elements" we have other ways to use elememts, we can "nest" elements, which means put elements inside other elements" that could further add meaning to the initial elements.

The list of HTML elements are pretty long and allows you to do such things as pust images, videos, lists, Forms, and generally... most of the set up of a whole page.

## Semantics

Semantics are refering to what the code actually means, it referes to what will happen with the code as it is ran. In the last paragraph I mentioned the various ways to use HTML and its possibilites such as "...lists and forms.." The best is example is the ``<form></form>`` element, it  is very straight forward and describes more or less what is going on within these tags. Within markup HTML has various semantic elements like

* ``<header></header>``
* ``<body></body>``
* ``<footer></footer>``

...to name a few.

these are very upfront about what their use is.The ``<h1>`` element and what is accomplishes is another easy one to understand, the "header" element enlarges the content within... by using simply one "tag"...there is another way to make the text larger however it require a "work around" and ends up being abit more "wordy" and cluttered there fore leaving the code a bit more messy whish isnt good in the world of coding. This approach may have some syntax value however it has no semantic value.
 Through various languages we utilize different syntax to accomplish a result that can be defined semantically the same.
