## Wire Frams

The initial reading in class 4 we learned about wire framing and its importance of it when designing a page. In reality wire framing is a plan or a course of action. It is sketching on paper or using an app to sketch the skeleton of the page you are working on. The example of having a destination before you get into a car is a very good one that I feel most people can relate to. There are not many instances where simply stepping into a vehicle with no destination in mind is a feasable idea, sure it can be fun but for me that sounds very unfun. Take it one step further, what if you were just stepping onto a bus, or any means of puplic transportation with no destination and minimal means to "survive"...That sounds like HELL to me. 

Wire Framing is sketching the skeleton.

During the reading in class 4 we learned basic HTML.
We came across different elements
