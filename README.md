# My growth mindset, how I intend to keep it, and alittle bit about myself.

## About myself 
Hello, my name is Chrisopher Lopez, I am 32 and currently work at Trader Joe's and I have been with that company for rougly **14 YEARS!!**.
I grew up in a house where music ðŸŽ¶ was a top "prioty". I grew up a drummer like my father and brother but of course learning to play several instrumemts was a *must* as well. besides ~~playing~~ *knowing* Drums well I feel proficient with playing the guitar ðŸŽ¸. However I can play others, but mainly based off of my study of music theory in college several years ago and not so much based off of the technical aspect of each intrument. Besides playing music i love listening to music of differet genres, my big time **favorites** have largely remained the same over the years. 

### What I am listening to now

## My Idea of a "Growth Mindset"

### Kaizen: *change for the better*
For Me A growth mindset is about perseverance. Its about "Showing up" and giving yourself **OVER TO** what ever you are learning (or taking part in).It is about making sure my current "best day" is equivilant to my future selfs "worst day"  and to continue growing,learning, and ultimatly finding new ways to discover and learn not only about my skateboarding/Music/task at hand, but also about myself and what I require to have input and stellar free flowing output on any given day. This is about not observes everything as challenges or simply *choices* but as **oppportunities** to better yourself therefore creating a special place for your loved ones.

## Reminders on how to keep the Growth Mindset

- Breath, There is nothing one cannot accompish with perspective and focus.
- Life has proven to be a tough, it might as well be tough while you work towards a life that is fulfilling.
- Similar Actions will acrue similar results, only when you change will you find a different result.
