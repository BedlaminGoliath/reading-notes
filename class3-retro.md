# Lessons learned from class 3 (a retrospect)

During the class 3 Lab and buildin my "site" I lerned how to go about the ACP process and how to actually problem solve, i ran into a "rejected" issue several times, partially because i had 2 folders with matching files and i believe that just messed eveerything up (okay thats what i think happened, after i deleted one, i didnt have that problem anymore). I did ask for help twice and I got it from my rad instructure and a super helpful TA. Only a few minutes ago I got the same error yet i managed to fix the problem i beleive.

`` [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/username.......``

what i did was did a ``git pull origin main`` from my understanding is doing just that, im "pulling" from my origin (my cloned location)

it is very possible i am wrong or incomplete with my findings, however from my few years of researching and learning about coding, learning to problem solve is a big part of this and im happy I managed to pull this off.

Another this I learned was the importance of using the comments method in markdown, as well as any language, by taking notes i would have saved myself alot of ``commits`` that did not need to happen. Although I am happy to have gotten so much practice on this (which i feel is important to how i learn) I feel i commited WAAAY too much... however... I still walked away with a lesson on the importance of (as mentioned above) leaving myself comments
