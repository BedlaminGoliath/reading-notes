# Lessons learned from class 3 (a retrospect)

During the class 3 Lab and buildin my "site" I lerned how to go about the ACP process and how to actually problem solve, I ran into a "rejected" issue several times, partially because I had 2 folders with matching files and i believe that just messed eveerything up (okay thats what i think happened, after i deleted one, i didnt have that problem anymore). I did ask for help twice and I got it from my rad instructure and a super helpful TA. Only a few minutes ago I got the same error yet I managed to fix the problem i beleive.

`` [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/username.......``

What I did was: ``git pull origin main`` from my understanding its doing just that, im "pulling" from my origin (my cloned location)

Pulled from [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)
> What is the difference between git pull and git pull?
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. The git pull command is a combination of git fetch and git merge . git pull will download the content from the remote repository. [^1]

It is very possible I am wrong or incomplete with my findings, however from my few years of researching and learning about coding, learning to problem solve is a big part of this and im happy I managed to pull this off.

Another thing I learned was the importance of using the comments in markdown, as well as any language, by taking notes I would have saved myself alot of ``commits`` that did not need to happen. Although I am happy to have gotten so much practice on this (which I feel is important to how I learn) I feel I commited WAAAY too much... however... I still walked away with a lesson on the importance of (as mentioned above) leaving myself comments.
